# Ignite Open Source (IOS)
**IOE Pulchowk Campus Student Community**

Welcome to **Ignite Open Source (IOS)** — the **first dedicated open-source community** at **Institute of Engineering, Pulchowk Campus**, focused on **research-driven development** and solving real-world problems in **Nepal**.

## What We Do

- **Research-driven**: We identify Nepal-specific problems through structured research before building solutions
- **Open-source first**: All tools are shared publicly on GitHub/PyPI for community benefit
- **Interdisciplinary**: Open to **all departments** — non-political and non-profit
- **Solution-oriented**: A complete pipeline from problem research → solution development → sharing

## Domains of Focus

We prioritize **AI for social good** and **ethical open-source development** in key Nepali sectors:

- **Healthcare** — Accessible diagnostics, patient data management, rural health monitoring
- **Education** — Adaptive learning platforms, resource-sharing tools for underserved areas
- **Government Transparency** — Open data tools, civic engagement platforms
- **Agriculture** — Farmer advisory apps, environmental monitoring

## Our Objectives

### Primary (Core Focus)
1. **Research** — Conduct thorough research on the Nepali market/context to identify key problems where open-source solutions can make a tangible difference
2. **Build** — Develop high-quality, open-source tools through active student collaboration to directly address identified problems

### Secondary (Supportive Activities)
3. **Events** — Organize hackathons, workshops, and collaborative events to promote innovation and teamwork
4. **Awareness** — Run tech awareness programs to educate the community about open-source potential
5. **Global Contributions** — Encourage and facilitate contributions to global open-source projects
6. **Education** — Develop resources to help beginners get started with coding and open-source

## Benefits
