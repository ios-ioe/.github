## Branch Naming Convention

Use clear, descriptive branch names:

* `feature/feature-name`
* `fix/bug-description`
* `docs/documentation-update`
* `research/topic-name`

Avoid vague names like `update`, `test`, or `changes`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

To help reviewers and maintain quality:

* Keep PRs **small and focused**
* One feature or fix per PR
* Clearly explain **what** you changed and **why**
* Link related issues if applicable
* Update documentation if behavior changes
* Ensure your code works before submitting

Pull requests may be requested for changes if they do not meet these guidelines.

---

## Issue Guidelines

Before opening an issue:

* Check if a similar issue already exists
* Use issue templates if available
* Provide clear descriptions and steps to reproduce bugs
* Include screenshots, logs, or examples when helpful

Well-written issues help everyone.

---

## Code Quality Expectations

* Write readable and maintainable code
* Follow existing project structure and style
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Avoid unnecessary complexity
* Comment only when logic is non-obvious

We value **clarity over cleverness**.

---

## Beginner-Friendly Contributions

Look for issues labeled:

* `good first issue`
* `beginner-friendly`
* `help wanted`

If you’re unsure about anything, ask questions in the issue or PR comments.
Maintainers and contributors are happy to help.

---

## Review Process

* Pull requests are reviewed by maintainers or contributors
* Feedback is constructive and meant to help you grow
* Please be open to suggestions and discussion
* Be respectful and patient during reviews

Learning through feedback is part of the process.
